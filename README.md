Puush in Linux
=====================

Takes screenshots and uploads them to puush using the puush API and copies the link to clipboard. Recommended for set up with keyboard shortcuts
<br>Utilises __gnome-screenshot__ for taking screenshots, __zenity__ for file uploads (both included in Ubuntu).

## Instructions
- Clone or download the repo
- Go to ~/.profile and put on a new line:
```
export PUUSH_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
  - where "your_api_key" is your puush api key (You can find your API key at http://puush.me/account/settings)
- Make it executable using __chmod +x puush__
- Place this file wherever you want (recommended: /usr/local/bin)
- Set up keyboard shortcuts within linux
  - (in Ubuntu it's system settings > keyboard > keyboard shortcuts > custom shortcuts)
  - Log out for the changes to take place
  - Here's what it looks like for mine: ![Puush keyboard setup](http://puu.sh/cOyVz/8dcb1cd498.png)

``` bash
puush -d		# puush desktop
puush -a		# area puush
